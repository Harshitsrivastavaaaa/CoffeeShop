Coffee Ordering and Billing Python Program

This Python program is designed to simulate a simple coffee shop ordering and billing system. It allows customers to select from a menu of coffee options, specify quantities, and then generates a detailed bill with the total amount payable.

Features:
- **Menu Display:** Presents a list of available coffee options along with their prices.
- **Order Taking:** Customers can select multiple coffee items and specify quantities.
- **Order Calculation:** Calculates the total cost for each item and the overall bill.
- **Billing:** Generates a clear and formatted bill showing each item, quantity, individual price, subtotal, and the final total.
- **User Interaction:** Provides a user-friendly interface through console prompts and input validation.

Functionality:
- The program uses dictionaries or lists to store menu items and prices.
- Loops to allow multiple items to be ordered.
- Basic error handling to ensure valid input.
- Final output displays an itemized bill with all charges included.

This program serves as a fundamental example of how to manage orders and billing in a retail or food service setting using Python.
